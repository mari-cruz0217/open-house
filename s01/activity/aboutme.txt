Zuitt motivated me when I first joined their one-day workshop and experienced it. That day, I learned a lot. When I saw a new post from Zuitt for another workshop, I didn't think twice and immediately registered for another free three-day workshop. I am truly grateful to Zuitt for providing us students with this kind of training at no cost.
